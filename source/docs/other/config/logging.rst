Logging in PhotonVision
=======================

In addition to storing logs in timestamped files in the config directory, PhotonVision streams logs to the web dashboard. These logs can be viewed later by pressing the \` key. In this view, logs can be filtered by level or downloaded.

.. note:: When the program first starts, it sends logs from startup to the client that first connects. This does not happen on subsequent connections.
