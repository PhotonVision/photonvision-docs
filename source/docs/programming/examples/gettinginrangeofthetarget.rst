Getting in Range of the Target
==============================

Knowledge and Equipment Needed
-----------------------------------------------

- Everything required in :ref:`Aiming at a Target <docs/programming/examples/aimingatatarget:Knowledge and Equipment Needed>`.
- Large space where your robot can move around freely

Code
-------

In FRC, a mechanism usually has to be a certain distance away from itâ€™s target in order to be effective and score. In the last example, we showed how to aim your robot at the target and now you will learn how to get it in a certain distance to the target. In order to properly complete this example, ensure that your robot is pointed towards the target, but this will not be necessary in the future. This example is similar to the previous one and will also be using the P term of the PID loop and PhotonLib, specifically the distance function of PhotonUtils. While the operator holds down a button, the robot will drive towards the target and get in range.
