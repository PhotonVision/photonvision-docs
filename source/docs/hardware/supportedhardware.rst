Supported Hardware
==================

PhotonVision is developed and tested on a number of Commercial, Off-the-Shelf (COTS) vision processing hardware solutions.

Supported Cameras
-----------------

PhotonVision works with Pi Cameras and most USB Cameras, the recommendations below are known to be working and have been tested. Other cameras such as webcams, virtual cameras, etc. are not officially supported and may not work. It is important to note that fisheye cameras should only be used as a driver camera and not for detecting targets.

PhotonVision relies on `CSCore <https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/cscore>`_ to detect and process cameras, so camera support is determined based off compatibility with CScore along with native support for the camera within your OS (ex. `V4L compatibility <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video4Linux>`_ if using a Linux machine like a Raspberry Pi).

Pi cameras are always recommended over USB cameras as they have lower latency and better performance compared to your average USB Camera.

* `Pi Camera Module V1 <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZZ2K7WP>`_ (General Target Tracking)

  * The V1 is strongly preferred over the V2 due to the V2 having undesirable FOV choices

* `Innomaker OV9281 Global Shutter Camera <https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-External-Monochrome-Bullseye-libcamera/dp/B09WTP5GZH>`_ (AprilTag Tracking)

.. note:: Note that there are many CSI based OV9281 cameras but this is the only one that has been tested by the development team.

* `Arducam USB OV9281 Global Shutter Camera <https://www.amazon.com/Arducam-Distortion-Microphones-Computer-Raspberry/dp/B096M5DKY6>`_ (AprilTag Tracking)

* `720p ELP Camera <https://www.amazon.com/SVPRO-Camera-Module-100degree-Distortion/dp/B07C1KYBYC>`_ (Retroreflective Target Tracking)

* `Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000 <https://www.andymark.com/products/microsoft-lifecam-hd-3000-camera>`_ (Driver Camera)

* `720p Fisheye ELP Camera <https://www.amazon.com/ELP-Camera-170degree-Megapixel-Security/dp/B00VTINRMK/>`_ (Driver Camera)

.. note:: If you test a camera and find that it works with PhotonVision, we encourage you to submit that camera to the performance matrix below.

.. warning::

    The following cameras / setups are known to not work:
    * Using two of the same USB cameras does not currently work because it is hard to identify the two different cameras.

    * Most Logitech cameras (specifically the Logitech C270 HD Webcam (PN: 960-000694)) will not work with PhotonVision.

    * The PS3Eye needs a workaround to be usable, for more information see :ref:`our Known Issues page <docs/troubleshooting/common-errors:Known Issues>`

    * Most laptop integrated webcams

Supported Coprocessors
----------------------
* Raspberry Pi 3 / 4, with the newest variants of each being preferred (3B+ and B, respectively).
* Raspberry Pi 4 is preferred for all forms of target tracking.
* Orange Pi 4 / 5 will have better performance but will require more work to get working.
* Mini PCs (such as Beelink N5095) have been testing and show significantly better performance than a Raspberry Pi, but require extra effort to wire to the robot / get set up. More information can be found in the set up guide `here. <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lOSzG8iNE43cK-PgJDDzbwtf6ASyf4vbW8lQuFswxzw/edit?usp=drivesdk>`_
* Other coprocessors can be used but may require some extra work / command line usage in order to get it working properly.
