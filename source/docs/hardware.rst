Supported Cameras
-----------------

We support any USB camera, however, Logitech cameras don't work well with PhotonVision. We recommend the Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000 Camera, which is available from Andymark. The Raspberry Pi Camera Module V1 and V2 are supported with a supported Rasberry Pi. Additionally, ELP webcam modules are also recommended which can be found on Amazon, Ebay, Alibaba, or many other online sources.

.. warning:: The Logitech C270 HD Webcam (PN: 960-000694) will not work with PhotonVision.
