AprilTags are a type of visual fiducial marker that is commonly used within robotics and computer vision applications. Visual fiducial markers are artificial landmarks added to a scene to allow "localization" (finding your current position) via images. In simpler terms, it is something that can act as a known point of reference that you can use to find your current location. They are similar to QR codes in which they encode information, however, they hold much less data. This has the added benefit of being much easier to track from long distances and at low resolutions. By placing AprilTags in known locations around the field and detecting them using PhotonVision, you can easily get full field localization / pose estimation. Alternatively, you can use AprilTags the same way you used retroreflective tape, simply using them to turn to goal without any pose estimation.
