Feedback
--------
Your feedback using PhotonVision is extremely important to us and our goal of delivering a robust vision tracking platform for all teams to use. This is even more important when testing fiducials, as it is a relatively new concept in FRC and needs to be consistent in order to prove to be a viable platform for future games. If you encounter any bugs or have any feedback at all, please :ref:`contact us  <index:Contact Us>`. Thank you for your patience and feedback!
